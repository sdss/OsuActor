## 0.4.0 - May 28, 2022

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes

* [#65](https://github.com/sdss/lvmieb/pull/65) Major refactor of `lmvieb`. Most actor commands have kept the same syntax but this version is generally a breaking change with respect to 0.3.0. The main changes are:

  * Split IEBController into several classes for motors, WAGO, pressure transducers, and depth probes. In the previos code the `IebController` handled everything but actually multiple instances are generated for each spectrograph, one for each type of device. In this version the `IEBController` is a simple collection of individual controllers.
  * Simplified a bit how the actor is instantiated from the configuration file to take advantage of the new `IEBController`.
  * Done some refactoring of the actor commands but for the most part the command names and options are the same.
  * Added a keyword schema and some general engineering tweaks.
  * Improvements to testing, docs building, etc.
